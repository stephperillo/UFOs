# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I have added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
This is what the completed webpage looks like:

It has a table with all of the data for one to scroll through. Alternatively, one can filter through the data by entering information in the input boxes. One can filter for a specific date, city, state, country, and/or shape of a UFO sighting.

How to perform a search on UFO Finder:
1. Scroll down until you see the Filter Search area on the left side of the page.
2. Click on the desired input field(s). This will make the text cursor appear and begin to blink (|).
3. Type the desired date or word (i.e. "ca" for State).
4. Press Enter to activate the filter and display the results of the search.

## Summary

This webpage has a visual banner and it shows the data in a nice table, and best of all is the filter functionality, however as is, it does have  drawbacks.

One drawback of this webpage is that it does not inherently include a way to add new data. The data currently on the webpage is from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. If there is additional data on if the sighting reports were verified by how many people or only person, that could be helpful to add. If a viewer of this site has seen a UFO, they can quickly add their comments and data. We would also need to add a way for this system to be monitored so that users are not able to abuse the website to post irrelevant or inappropriate text. There would be a gap between the time any new data was entered and when it appears on the webpage so that all entries can be proofread by a human before going live.      

Two additional recommendations for further development are:
1. Add a way for new data to be added to a table.
2. Another filter that can be added is for a keyword in the comments so that one can search more effectively.

A third improvement would be to add the function of filtering for a range of dates instead of a single date. 
Another improvement to the filter would be to include options for if the user misspells the city or country name. The result could show the suggested data: 
> "*'roswel'* was not found; here are some similar results: [shows data for *'roswell'*]" 

This would be similar to how Google.com functions for a search that has no 100% exact match.
Another simple adjustment would be to add links for more information. For example, a separate link to World UFO Day, which would include the date, location, images, and details about the celebration. We can also link to more inforation about Dr. Ursula F. Olivier's research and the Leave Aliens Alone (LAA) community information.
